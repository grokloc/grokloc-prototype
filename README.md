# What is this?

This is a repository specifically set aside for rapid prototyping and brainstorming
of GrokLOC features. The code is in Perl. Code may or may not strictly correspond
to things in other GrokLOC repositories, and there should be no expectation of
clarity, documentation, testing etc.

# Status
